## Generating Custom Random Passwords
The focus of the project has been to seek out an simple and comfortable design for writing
REST API

## Tools
I used Initializer to load my services such as `router` `databases` and so on
the only endpoint is for generating custom random passwords
You can see the details of payload and response in the swagger doc provided in this project
I also use `viper` for config management

## Install and Run Tests and Check Lint
